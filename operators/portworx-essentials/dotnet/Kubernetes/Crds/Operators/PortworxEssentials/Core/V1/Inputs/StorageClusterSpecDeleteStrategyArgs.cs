When no delete strategy only objects managed by the StorageCluster controller and owned by the StorageCluster object are deleted. The storage driver will be left in a state where it will not be managed by any object. Uninstall strategy ensures that the cluster is completely uninstalled even from the storage driver perspective. UninstallAndWipe strategy ensures that the cluster is completely uninstalled as well as the storage devices and metadata are wiped for reuse. This may result in data loss.
