If the provisioner can support VolumeSnapshot data source, it will create a new volume and data will be restored to the volume at the same time. If the provisioner does not support VolumeSnapshot data source, volume will not be created and the failure will be reported as an event. In the future, we plan to support more data source types and the behavior of the provisioner may change.
